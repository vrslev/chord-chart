# Python and JavaScript library for chord chart validation and transposition.

Validate & format chart in this format:

```
|D G| Bm A|
 | Bm A/C# |D G|Bm A |
```

to this:

```
| D G | Bm A |
| Bm A/C# | D G | Bm A |
```

and traspose the notes to this (from D to H):

```
| H E | G#m F# |
| G#m F#/A# | H E | G#m F# |
```

or any other key.
